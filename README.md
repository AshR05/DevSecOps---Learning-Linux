# DevOps Learning - Fundamentals of Linux 
This repository contains my practical exercises, notes, and challenge solutions from the Linux module of the CoderCo DevOps course. It reflects my hands-on learning in Linux fundamentals, command-line tools, and system administration.



## What I Learnt:

- 🧭 Navigating the file system — mastering commands like cd, ls, pwd, and cat made me feel at home in the terminal.
- 🔑 File permissions & ownership — understanding chmod, chown, and sudo gave me a real appreciation for how Linux handles security.
- 📦 Working with files & processes — using grep, find, ps, and kill helped me understand how Linux thinks and organises tasks.
- ⚙️ SSH and remote connections — connecting securely to a remote machine for the first time felt like unlocking a new level of control.

 ## Over The Wire Bandit Journey

The aim was to complete 20 levels of Over The Wire; however, I managed to complete 16 levels, which provided practical experience in:
- Confident use of SSH for remote connections
- Handling hidden and special files
- Working with file permissions and ownership
- Using core Linux utilities: grep, sort, uniq, find, cat, strings, diff, base64, xxd, nc, and more
- Understanding SUID binaries and port-based communication
- Applying encoding and decoding techniques (Base64, ROT13, hex)
- Strengthening troubleshooting, patience, and research abilities through documentation and man pages


**PLAN:** Complete levels 17 to 20!
