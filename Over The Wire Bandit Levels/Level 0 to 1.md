# Level 0 to 1

**GOAL:**  
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory.

---

### Solution:

- Once logged in, I ran `pwd` to confirm I was in the home directory.  
- I used `ls` to list the contents of the directory and found a file named `readme`.  
- I then used the `cat` command to read the file and obtained the password

```bash
cat readme
```
